# ProjectAI5
**Problem Statement:**
The problem at hand is the development of an AI-based Diabetes Prediction System.
The aim is to create a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual
having diabetes based on certain features. This system has the potential to assist
healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention, thereby improving patient
outcomes.
**Design Thinking Process:**
1. **Empathize:** Understand the needs of healthcare professionals and patients.
Gather insights into the challenges of diabetes diagnosis and management.
2. **Define:** Clearly define the problem and set specific goals for the AI system. Define
the features that will be used for prediction.
3. **Ideate:** Explore various AI and machine learning techniques suitable for predicting
diabetes. Consider the ethical implications and data privacy concerns.
4. **Prototype:** Develop a prototype of the prediction system using a sample dataset.
Test the prototype and gather feedback for improvement.
5. **Test:** Evaluate the prototype's performance on a larger dataset. Refine the model
based on test results and feedback.
6. **Implement:** Integrate the final model into a user-friendly interface for healthcare
professionals to use in real-world scenarios.
**Phases of Development:**
1. **Data Collection:** Gather a comprehensive dataset containing relevant features
such as age, BMI, family history, blood pressure, etc.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
- Handle missing data through imputation or removal.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features.
- Encode categorical variables.
3. **Feature Selection:**
- Use statistical methods (e.g., correlation analysis) to identify relevant features.
- Apply machine learning-based feature selection techniques (e.g., recursive feature
elimination).
4. **Model Selection:**
- Choose a machine learning algorithm suitable for binary classification (diabetic or
not diabetic).
- Consider algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector
Machines.
5. **Model Training:**
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
○ Collect a dataset with features like age, BMI, family history, blood
pressure, etc.
2. Data Preprocessing:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv("diabetes_dataset.csv")
# Handle missing data
data = data.dropna()
# Split into features and target
X = data.drop("Outcome", axis=1)
y = data["Outcome"]
# Normalize numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
# Encode categorical variables if any
# ...
# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2,
random_state=42)
3.Feature Selection:
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif
# Select top k features based on ANOVA F-statistic
k_best = SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=5)
X_train_selected = k_best.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
X_test_selected = k_best.transform(X_test)
4.Model Selection:
○ Choose a suitable algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression).
5.Model Training:
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
# Create and train the model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_selected, y_train)

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report,
confusion_matrix
# Make predictions
